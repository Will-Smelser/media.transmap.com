    <h1>Our Services</h1>

    <h2>ON-SIGHT™ Mobile Mapping</h2>
    <p>Transmap uses its ON-SIGHT™ HD Mobile Mapping System to capture ground-based LiDAR, 360 degree street-level, photogrammetric images and a dedicated HD camera scanning for pavement distresses.  The ON-SIGHT™ HD Mobile Mapping System collects data at normal driving speeds so special traffic control devices are not required during data collection.</p>

    <h2>Pavement Management</h2>
    <p>
        After the data collection process is completed, Transmap will assess the condition of all roadways in a network using the digital image database captured during raw data collection in the field.  Trained pavement technicians rate both the type of distress (alligator cracking, edge cracking, potholes, etc.), as well as the severity of each distress, following the guidelines established by the ASTM D6433 standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        Transmap uses a profilometer to collect rutting and ride data.  The profiler meets all ASTM E950 standards.  The International Roughness Index (IRI) is collected for the left wheel track, the right wheel track, and the average of the two wheel tracks.
    </p>
    <h2>Asset Management</h2>
    <p>
        We have been collecting roadway assets for over 20 years with the ability to inventory the assets that provide cost savings for our customers.  Some of these assets include traffic signs, traffic signals and poles, sidewalks, curbs, manholes, water valves, parking meters, hydrants, power vaults, gas valves, survey monuments, catch basins, light poles, drop inlets, pavement markings, guide rails, culverts, ditches, speed zones, school zones, cross walks, and street trees.
    </p>
    <h3>Sign Inventory</h3>
    <p>
        Through our technology and our expert employees, Transmap can meet and exceed the data requirements for the condition assessment of all signs.  These services include, but are not limited to: Sign location (within 1 meter), sign orientation, sign position, MUTCD code, standard width and height, sign structure, post structure condition, sign condition, etc.
    </p>
    <h3>Nighttime Sign Inspections & Retroreflectivity</h3>
    <p>
        Transmap can use the MUTCD nighttime visual inspection requirements to assess the retroreflectivity of each sign along with a daytime condition assessment.
    </p>

    <h2>Web GIS</h2>
    <p>
        Transmap has been a Public Works Solutions Partner with Esri for over 20 years.  We are extremely well-versed in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and how to best utilize GIS tools in the infrastructure management needs of our customers. With an increasingly changing software environment, Transmap’s open source policy allows for data to be seamlessly implemented into dozens of software systems.
